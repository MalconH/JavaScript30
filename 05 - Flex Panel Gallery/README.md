# Flex panel gallery
[My Solution](flex-gallery.html) - [Wes Bos' Solution](index-FINISHED.html)

## 💭 Recap 
This challenge was at first sight simple, but as I wanted to give a tweak, it got tricky.
The Wes' solution lets you open 2 panels at the same time, which I didn't like quite much so I changed it.
Besides that the functionality is pretty much CSS doing its magic with a bit of JS.

## 💡 Additions of my own
- As said, if you open a new panel the last one will close.
- Hover effect using CSS `filter` property. 

## 🤓☝🏻 What I learned
- Cool usage for `cubic-bezier` function in CSS to give this "bouncy" feeling while opening a panel.
- I practiced things that I learned along the way 👌🏻.

## 🔧 Installation
Simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` in your browser.

Thanks for reading 👋🏻
